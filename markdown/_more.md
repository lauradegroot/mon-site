<h1>More…</h1>

<img class='me' src='assets/me_glitch.jpg' /> My name is Ricky Miller…

During the day my jam is making internet. When I'm not making internet, I'm either: eating, sleeping, cycling or playing videogames.

Lately my focus has been on creating expressive, dynamic experiences with things like [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Three.js](http://threejs.org/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).

You can usually find me being silly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmill/), but you can also [email me](mailto:ricky.miller@gmail.com) or /msg <em>rmill</em> on freenode IRC (that's where all the [cool kids](https://github.com/ot-crew) hang out).

Here is my collection of random [images](http://rmill.ca/i/) (inspired by [@wilto](https://twitter.com/wilto/))

Later alligator,
